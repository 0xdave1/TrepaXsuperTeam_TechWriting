#  Understanding Prediction Markets in Web3  
A Beginner-Friendly Guide & Classification of Forecasting Projects  

This project is my submission for the *Trepa x Superteam Korea Technical Writing Challenge*.  
It explores *prediction markets and forecasting projects in Web3, classifying them based on their **technology, resolution methods, and incentive mechanics* ‚Äî so developers, users, and investors can better understand their tradeoffs.

##  Project Overview  

Prediction markets are systems that allow participants to express probabilistic beliefs about future events ‚Äî from elections and sports to crypto prices and macroeconomic indicators.  
In Web3, they often take the form of markets where users buy and sell "shares" representing possible outcomes, with prices reflecting collective probability estimates.  

### Why They Matter  
- *Better Decision-Making:* Aggregate diverse information into a single probability.  
- *Efficient Risk Management:* Hedge against future uncertainty (e.g., inflation, protocol risk).  
- *Incentivized Truth-Seeking:* Reward accuracy, penalize noise, and surface better forecasts.

##  Classification Framework  

This guide classifies prediction/forecasting projects across three dimensions:  

| *Dimension* | *Definition* | *Why It Matters* |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Outcome Resolution Method | How the system determines the ‚Äútruth‚Äù of an event. | Defines trust assumptions and attack surface. |
| Technical Infrastructure | Whether trading and settlement are on-chain, off-chain, or hybrid. | Affects decentralization, cost, and UX. |
| Market Mechanic / Incentive Model | How users place forecasts (AMMs, order books, tournaments). | Shapes liquidity and price discovery. |

##  Categories of Projects  

### 1. On-Chain Automated Markets (Oracle-Resolved)  
Fully on-chain systems using smart contracts and oracles.  
Examples: *Polymarket, **Azuro Protocol*  

*Pros:* Trust-minimized, composable, censorship-resistant  
*Cons:* Oracle risks, gas fees, UX friction  

---

### 2. Human-Resolved Forecasting Platforms (Off-Chain)  
Markets resolved by community panels or authority figures, often with custodial funds.  
Examples: *Metaculus, **Manifold Markets*  

*Pros:* Easy to use, fast market creation  
*Cons:* Requires trust in human resolution, not censorship-resistant  

---

### 3. Hybrid Resolution Systems  
Blend automated oracles with human dispute resolution.  
Examples: *Omen (Gnosis), **Augur*  

*Pros:* Reliable with human fallback, permissionless  
*Cons:* Slower settlement, governance complexity  

---

### 4. Non-Market Forecasting Alternatives  
Forecasting tournaments or expert panels without monetary stakes.  
Examples: *Good Judgment Open, **Samotsvety*  

*Pros:* Great for expert communities  
*Cons:* No liquidity or hedging utility

##  Trepa: A Fresh Take  

Trepa introduces *numerical forecasting markets* where users are rewarded based on how close they are to the actual outcome ‚Äî making prediction markets more realistic and valuable for decision-making.
